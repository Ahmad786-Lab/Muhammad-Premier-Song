I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me<br>
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me<br>
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me<br>
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me<br>
I don't wanna die for them to miss me<br>
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me<br>
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me<br>
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me<br>
</p>

God's plan, God's plan<br>
I hold back, sometimes I won't, yeah<br>
I feel good, sometimes I don't, ayy, don't<br>
I finessed down Weston Road, ayy, 'nessed<br>
Might go down a G-O-D, yeah, wait<br>
I go hard on Southside G, yeah, Way<br>
I make sure that north side eat<br>
And still<br>

She say, "Do you love me?" I tell her, "Only partly <br>
I only love my bed and my momma, I'm sorry" <br>
Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me <br>
81, they'll bring the crashers to the party <br>
And you know me <br>
Turn the O2 into the O3, dog <br>
Without 40, Oli', there'd be no me <br>
'Magine if I never met the broskis <br>
</p>

<p>
God's plan, God's plan <br>
I can't do this on my own, ayy, no, ayy <br>
Someone watchin' this shit close, yep, close <br>
I've been me since Scarlett Road, ayy, road, ayy <br>
Might go down as G-O-D, yeah, wait <br>
I go hard on Southside G, ayy, Way <br>
I make sure that north side eat, yuh <br>
And still<br>
